      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Octavius Guy and I'm 22 years old. I have Bachelor's degree in game design which partially peaked my interest in software development.</p>
      <p>I've always wanted to puruse a career in technology my entire life which led me originally into the path of game design. I also wanted to learn
      how to create softwares and the inner workings of ai to apply to my gaming knowledge. I dreamt of creating a social network that specifically focuses
      people's interests and allowing them to join communities for those specific interests. It would also use ai and be heavily structured to personalize 
      the user experience for the user such as sports news for sports fans and being allowed to score movies for moviegoers.     
      </p>
      <p>My favorite food is Japanese steak fried rice followed by Detroit-style pizza.</p>
